EXP 3 : Study of tuple in python

THEORY :-

A tuple in Python is an ordered and immutable collection of elements. Tuples are written using round brackets ( ), and elements are separated by commas. Tuples can store heterogeneous data types such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans.

Key Characteristics of Tuples

Tuples are immutable (cannot be modified after creation)

Elements are accessed using indexing

Supports slicing

Allows duplicate values

Faster than lists and used for fixed data

Explanation of Programs

Creating and Printing a Tuple A tuple is created with different data types and printed using print().

Accessing Tuple Elements Tuple elements are accessed using index values, starting from 0.

Slicing a Tuple Slicing is used to extract a range of elements from a tuple.

Tuple Repetition Using * Operator The * operator repeats tuple elements multiple times.

Difference Between (10)*5 and (10,)*5

(10)*5 performs arithmetic multiplication

(10,)*5 creates a tuple with repeated elements

List vs Tuple Memory Behavior

Tuples have a fixed memory location

Lists can change their memory address due to mutability

Tuple Functions Built-in functions like count() are used to count occurrences of elements in a tuple.

ALGORITHM :-

Student Marks Tuple
Step 1: Start

Step 2: Create a tuple containing student marks

Step 3: Store marks in a tuple variable

Step 4: Display the tuple

Step 5: Stop

Student Details Tuple
Step 1: Start

Step 2: Create a tuple containing subject name, marks, and grade

Step 3: Store the details in a tuple variable

Step 4: Display the tuple

Step 5: Stop

Attendance Count Using Tuple
Step 1: Start

Step 2: Create a tuple containing attendance values (P and A)

Step 3: Use the count() function to count total present days

Step 4: Display the total number of present days

Step 5: Stop

CONCLUSION :-

In this experiment, we studied the concept of tuples in Python. We learned how to create tuples, access their elements using indexing and slicing, and perform operations such as repetition and counting elements. The experiment also highlighted the key difference between lists and tuples, especially regarding immutability and memory behavior. From this study, it is concluded that tuples are best suited for storing fixed and unchangeable data, making them more secure and memory-efficient compared to lists.
